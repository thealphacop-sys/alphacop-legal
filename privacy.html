  <h1>Privacy Policy for Alpha Cop</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 19, 2026</p>

  <p>Alpha Cop LLC ("Company," "we," "our," or "us") operates the Alpha Cop mobile application ("App"). 
  This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Alpha Cop does not directly collect, store, transmit, or process personal information from users.</p>

  <p>The only user-related data involved in the operation of the App is processed exclusively by Apple through its App Store and StoreKit systems, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple ID account authentication</li>
    <li>Auto-renewable subscription management</li>
    <li>Billing and payment processing</li>
    <li>App Store reviews voluntarily submitted by users</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alpha Cop LLC does not have access to your Apple ID credentials, payment information, or subscription billing details.</p>

  <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>All subscription purchases, renewals, cancellations, and billing matters are handled directly by Apple. 
  Subscriptions may be managed in your device settings under:</p>
  <p><em>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</em></p>

  <p>We do not store payment information or process payments directly.</p>

  <h2>3. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>Alpha Cop does not use third-party analytics services, advertising networks, tracking technologies, or cookies.</p>

  <h2>4. App Store Reviews</h2>
  <p>If you submit a review through the App Store, that information is publicly displayed and managed by Apple. 
  We do not control or modify App Store review data.</p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Alpha Cop is not directed to children under the age of 13. 
  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because Alpha Cop does not collect or store user data on its own servers, we rely on Apple’s secure infrastructure for authentication and payment processing.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. 
  Updates will be reflected by revising the “Last Updated” date above.</p>
